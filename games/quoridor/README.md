}
```

The first player that appears in the `players` list is the player that makes the first play and that start at the top center. The second player will have the seconde play and start at the bottom.

`current` is the indice of the current player in the `players` list.

The `blockers` key contains the number of blocker each players (depending on its indice) has left.

The `board` is a a list of 17 lists containing 17 numbers, 9 for the tiles the pawns can move on plus 8 for the places between tiles where we can put a blocker. The elements of the array can take 5 values:
- PAWN1 = 0 for the pawn of the first player in the players list
- PAWN2 = 1 for the pawn of the second player in the players list
- EMPTY_PAWN = 2 for an empty tile
- EMPTY_BLOCKER = 3 for the absence of a blocker between two tiles
- BLOCKER = 4 for a blocker between two tiles
- IMP = 5 for positions that are impossible and can not be modified, as they don't represent anything. They are the elements a the intersection between blockers or empty_blockers that are necessary if we want to represent the board as a 2D array.

## A Move

```json
  {
    "type": "pawn", //or "blocker"
    "position": [[0,8]] //a list of two lists for a blocker like [[11,8],[10,8]] or of one list for a pawn 
  }
```

The `type` contains the type of move the current player is making. "pawn" if he wants to move its pawn, "blocker" if he wants to add a blocker to the board.

The `position` key contains a list with the new position of the current player pawn if the move type is "pawn" or the two positions of the new blocker if the move type is blocker.

If the same state (same player turn + same board configuration) occurs more than 2 times, the game is over with a draw.
